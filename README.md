# The Almanac
This game was created by a group of three students (me being one) using the Unity game engine.

If you are having trouble getting the project to work you can download the executable file from
our website https://cruz085.wixsite.com/thedreamteam

If you go to the website, select the button "Download & Play Now!"
It's at the bottom of the home page.
You will then be directed to a google drive where you can download and play our game.
The executable file will only play on a pc.
