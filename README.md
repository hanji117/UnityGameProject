# The Almanac
Two other students and I created this game using the Unity game engine.

There is a playable version for Mac in this repository.
For PC you would have to download the files and open the game through Unity.

If you are having trouble getting the project to work you can download the executable file from
our website https://cruz085.wixsite.com/thedreamteam

If you go to the website, select the button "Download & Play Now!"
It's at the bottom of the home page. You will then be directed to a google drive where you can download and play our game.
The executable file will only play on a pc.

Game Guide:
You start off in a town. Go left to exit the town. You'll then appear outside. Follow the road. Go left and you'll 
find a building. Skeleton monsters will begin to appear. To enter the building, you have to kill 10 skeleton monsters. 
Point the mouses arrow in the direction you want to attack. Left click to use your basic attack. Right click to use 
a more powerful attack. You'll hear a Legend of Zelda sound when you've completed the task. Go inside to fight a boss monster. 
Once you defeat it, walk to the left to exit.
