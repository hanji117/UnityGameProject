# The Almanac
Two other students and I created this game using the Unity game engine.

There is a playable version for Mac in this repository. Download it to play.
For PC you could download the files and open the game through Unity or you could download 
the game through our website https://cruz085.wixsite.com/thedreamteam

If you go to our website, select the button "Download & Play Now!" to download the game.
It's at the bottom of the home page. You will then be directed to a google drive where you can download and play our game.
This executable file will only play on a pc.

Game configuration:
Before you begin to play a window will pop up asking you to select what screen resolution and graphics you want. 
I recommend selecting 1650 * 1050 for screen resolution, click the windowed box, and select "good" for graphics 
quality. This helps avoid lag.

Game Guide:
You start off in a town. Go left to exit the town. You'll then appear outside. Follow the road. Go left and you'll 
find a building. Skeleton monsters will begin to appear. To enter the building, you have to kill 10 skeleton monsters. 
Point the mouses arrow in the direction you want to attack. Left click to use your basic attack. Right click to use 
a powerful attack. You'll hear a Legend of Zelda sound when you've completed the task. Go inside to fight a boss monster. 
Once you defeat it, walk to the left to exit.
